# Production Discord Bot Configuration - FIXED! ðŸŽ‰

## Issue Resolution
âœ… **FIXED**: Updated webapp to use your Railway Discord bot URL instead of localhost

## Production Configuration

### Vercel Environment Variables (Already Set)
```bash
DISCORD_BOT_API_URL=https://ot-production.up.railway.app
WEBAPP_BOT_SECRET=your-production-secret
```

### Webapp Code Changes
- Updated to prioritize `DISCORD_BOT_API_URL` over `DISCORD_BOT_URL`
- Fallback chain: Railway â†’ Local â†’ Default
- Better error messages showing exact URL being used

### Verification
âœ… **Railway Bot Health Check**: 
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "bot": "connected", 
  "timestamp": "2025-09-13T17:21:29.891Z"
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Environment Variable Priority
```javascript
const DISCORD_BOT_URL = 
  process.env.DISCORD_BOT_API_URL ||     // Production (Railway)
  process.env.DISCORD_BOT_URL ||         // Local development  
  'http://localhost:8080'                // Fallback
```

### URL Resolution
- **Production (Vercel)**: Uses `https://ot-production.up.railway.app`
- **Local Development**: Uses `http://localhost:8080`
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/create-role` (same for both)

## Role Sync Should Now Work! ðŸš€

### Individual Role Sync
1. Go to `https://orbistech.dev/790/alliance/roles`
2. Look for roles with yellow dots (unsynced)
3. Click the ðŸ”„ button on each role
4. Should now connect to Railway bot successfully

### Bulk Role Sync  
1. Click "Sync to Discord" button
2. All 8 roles should sync to Railway bot
3. Discord roles created in your Discord server

## Expected Flow
```

```

## Debugging Information

### Error Messages Now Show
If something goes wrong, you'll see exactly which URL is being used:
```json
{
  "error": "Discord bot is not running",
  "details": "Cannot connect to Discord bot at https://ot-production.up.railway.app",
  "botUrl": "https://ot-production.up.railway.app"
}
```

### Health Check
Test the bot directly:
```bash
curl https://ot-production.up.railway.app/health
```

1. âœ… Railway Discord bot is running and healthy
2. âœ… Webapp configured to use Railway URL  
3. âœ… Individual sync buttons available
4. âœ… Better error handling and debugging
5. âœ… Environment variables properly configured

Try syncing your 8 unsynced roles now! ðŸŽ¯
